# GitLab Community Edition

[GitLab Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/) is an application to code, test, and deploy code together. It provides Git repository management with fine grained access controls, code reviews, issue tracking, activity feeds, wikis, and continuous integration. 

## Introduction

This chart stands up a GitLab Community Edition install. This includes:

- A [GitLab Omnibus](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/) Pod
- Redis
- Postgresql

## Prerequisites

- _At least_ 3 GB of RAM available on your cluster, in chunks of 1 GB
- Kubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- The ability to point a DNS entry or URL at your GitLab install

## Installing the Chart

run
```
   make deploy
```

## Persistence

By default, persistence of GitLab data and configuration happens using PVCs. If you know that you'll need a larger amount of space, make _sure_ to look at the `persistence` section in [values.yaml](values.yaml).

> *"If you disable persistence, the contents of your volume(s) will only last as long as the Pod does. Upgrading or changing certain settings may lead to data loss without persistence."*
